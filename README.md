# Baby_Circulatory_SemGen_Merge_10

Ten CellML modules of the baby circulatory vessels were created using bond graph principles. As the source of flow, a Fourier function was fitted to the Left Ventricular output flow generated by the Cardiovascular Circulation model (https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/4ac) and the function was used as a CellML module (LV.cellml).
Using SemGen, these eleven CellML BG modules were merged as in "BG_lump_network.png".
 
 
 Each vessel's specific info (radius and length) was mapped from the "vesselsInfo.cellml" to the resultant whole merged model "total.cellml".
