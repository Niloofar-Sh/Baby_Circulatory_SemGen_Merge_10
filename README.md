# Baby_Circulatory_SemGen_Merge_10

Ten CellML modules of the baby circulatory vessels were created using bond graph principles. As the source of flow, a Fourier function was fitted to the Left Ventricular output flow generated by the Cardiovascular Circulation model (https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/4ac) and the function was used as a CellML module (LV.cellml). The extracted data points were saved in "main_ADAN-86-V_aov-data.csv" and the fitting session using MATLAB is also available as "v_LV_fit_session.sfit".

Using SemGen, these eleven CellML BG modules were merged as in "BG_lump_network.png". Modules need to be merged in pairs so for merging (n) modules, (n-1) merging tasks are required. "block1.cellml"...."block9.cellml" show each step of merging the vessels and finally "block9.cellml" is merged with the source of flow ("LV.cellml") and produce "total.cellml".
 
 
 Each vessel's specific info (radius and length) can also be mapped from the "vesselsInfo.cellml" to the resultant whole merged model "total.cellml".
 The simulation result of the whole model was also imported into Jupyter Notebook as in "Simulation_results.ipynb", where the Kernel is set to OpenCOR.
